      <h1>Hello.</h1>

      <h2>My name is <span class="name">Kerri Mark Sharp</span>.</h2>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>I am a British software engineer and web developer.</p>

      <p>I currently live in Somerset, England with my wife and our daughter.</p>

      <p>
        I am the founder of <a href="//razor.wtf" target="_blank" rel="external">Razor Sharp</a>, where I offer Digital
        Handyman services, including website &amp; app development, AI &amp; automations and technical support.

        space for experiments, writing &amp; thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy making simple and clean <a href="/websites">websites</a> and applications.</p>

      <p>
        In the past, I have been a podcast host, journalist, radio &amp; club DJ and record label manager. I even once
        worked as head of digital for an election campaign. Digital media, and especially the internet, is very
        important to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am curious, empathetic and always seeking the truth. My most firmly held value is to "see the bigger picture".
        Critical thinking and asking questions are very important to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy singing, dancing, music, pantomime and musical theatre. I have also recently discoverd that I enjoy
        sauna &amp; cold plunge. My favourite video games are Tetris, Age of Empires 2 &amp; Mario Kart.
