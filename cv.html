        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Crafted a next-generation frontend with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind &amp; Storybook as part of a Scrum
            team, deployed with Vercel. This greenfield SaaS empowered the company to package risk &amp; intelligence
            services in a unique way to a plethora of new customers.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a "Service Status" page as part of a team, interpreting uptime statistics from AWS CloudWatch,
            deployed as an AWS Lambda, written in Go 1.20 with a frontend written in React, TypeScript &amp; Tailwind.
            This tool enabled customer to always know the status of the service, reducing support tickets and customer
            confusion.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led a team as project manager to build a "Spotify Wrapped"-alike using React, Vite, TypeScript, CSS &amp;
            deployed with Netlify. Using internal APIs, we annually summarised the efforts of our intelligence analysts
            with a humorous presentation, improving team morale &amp; encouraging competition.
          </li>

          <li>
            Contributed to building an AI virtual assistant platform leveraging Go 1.20 & AWS Bedrock, integrating
            Claude 3.5 to deliver context-rich customer interactions.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a fully-documented REST API using PHP 8 (Slim), PostgreSQL &amp; deployed via AWS to enable
            customers to share user generated content with their colleagues within the company's applications.
          </li>

          <li>
            Helped create an AWS Lambda written in Go 1.20, which continuously processes &amp; sends notifications from
            AWS SQS payloads, offering enhanced user customisation of notifications and savings on third-party service
            costs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built multi-factor authentication and authentication logging with PHP 8 (Slim) into the internal
            "Authentication" REST API, improving application security & enabling the acquisition of customers with
            enhanced security needs.
          </li>

          <li class="screen-only">
            Implemented the third-party "Dragonfly" API to display their data alongside internally published
            intelligence using PHP 8 (Lumen) to provide customers with more sources.
          </li>

          <li class="screen-only">
            Built a "Developer" website in Jekyll (Markdown, Liquid, SASS, JS) to document the company's APIs, resulting
            in increased sales from API-only customers.
          </li>

          <li class="screen-only">
            Delved into CQRS to update a legacy, event-driven, PHP API (Lumen), allowing intelligence analysts to keep
            information and statistics up-to-date via the event stream.
          </li>

          <li class="screen-only">
            Enhanced incident email notifications by dynamically generating map images using PHP 8 (Slim), MapTiler API,
            MJML & CSS, improving client awareness of threats or dangers occurring in their locations of interest.

        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a WordPress theme using PHP, SASS &amp; JS (ES6, jQuery) as a central part of the company's global
            rebrand. By writing bespoke features, I reduced the reliance on third-party WordPress plugins from 63 down
            to 4. This vastly improved page load time and reduced employee frustration by making the website simpler to
            manage.
          </li>

          <li>
            Built a WordPress plugin using PHP 7.4, JS (jQuery) &amp; CSS to create an asynchronous learning platform,
            empowering thousands of delegates globally to access workshop materials on-demand in multiple languages. My
            work replaced an expensive, third-party solution, prone to frequent outages.
          </li>

          <li>
            Converted a WordPress "multisite" into several, smaller databases with MySQL, giving all global branches the
            flexibility to manage, localise & translate their own websites to meet their regional marketing and sales
            goals.

          <h2 class="position">Web Developer, Opia</h2>

          <span class="dates">Jun 2016 &ndash; Nov 2020</span>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed hundreds of sales promotion websites for clients including Google, Dell &amp; HP using PHP 7.4
            (Laravel, Symfony, Blade), Vue.js, SASS (Bootstrap) &amp; MySQL, deployed via DigitalOcean with Docker &amp;
            Jenkins. These campaigns rewarded customers with cashback and gifts, incentivising tens of thousands of
            purchases, helping Opia's clients to meet their sales targets and strengthen brand loyalty.
          </li>

          <li>
            Led email campaign development, creating responsive HTML emails (MJML, Foundation for Email), tested with
            Litmus and delivered via Mailgun on behalf of clients including Samsung, Microsoft &amp; LG. My work
            increased trust by reinforcing brand identity across digital communications and garnered positive client
            &amp; customer feedback.
          </li>

          <li class="screen-only">
            Created a serial number validation system with PHP regex pattern matching to pre-validate customer claims.
            This reduced the amount of exploratory work required by the customer service team, minimising customer
            frustration.
          </li>

          <li>
            Represented the company at industry events by delivering presentations promoting best practices in
            responsive HTML email development. This helped establish Opia as a forward-thinking, tech-first employer and
            increased the number of job applications received from developers.
