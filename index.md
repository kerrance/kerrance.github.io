  <h1>Hello.</h1>

  <h2>My name is <span class="name">Kerri Mark Sharp</span>.</h2>
</header>

<main>
  <p>I am a British software engineer and web developer.</p>

  <p>I currently live in Somerset, England with my wife and our daughter.</p>

  <p>
    I am the founder of <a href="//razorsharp.digital" target="_blank" rel="external">Razor Sharp</a>, where I offer
    Digital Handyman services, including website &amp; app development, AI &amp; automations and technical support.
  </p>

  <p>I enjoy making simple and clean <a href="/websites">websites</a> and applications.</p>

  <p>I also occasionally <a href="/blog">publish my writing</a>.</p>

  <p>
    In the past, I have been a podcast host, journalist, radio &amp; club DJ and record label manager. I even once
    worked as head of digital for an election campaign. Digital media, and especially the internet, is very
    important to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am curious, empathetic and always seeking the truth. My most firmly held value is to "see the bigger picture".
    Critical thinking and asking questions are very important to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy singing, dancing, music, pantomime and musical theatre. I have also recently discovered that I enjoy
    sauna &amp; cold plunge. My favourite video games are Pokémon, Tetris, Age of Empires 2 &amp; Mario Kart.
  </p>

  <p>
    My claim to fame is that I am mentioned in the song
    <a href="//youtube.com/watch?v=e9kff6P7mKU" target="_blank" rel="external">Fans (Are So Cool)</a> by Kero Kero
    Bonito.
