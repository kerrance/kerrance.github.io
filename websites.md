      <h2>My philosophy</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      I have been building websites using HTML & CSS as a hobby since 1999. I first dabbled with PHP & MySQL in 2003
      when I hosted an open-source forum software for my friends to exchange messages online after school (wannabe
      Mark Zuckerberg?! haha).
    </p>

    <p>
      My initial foray into professional web development as a career involved working for agencies. Whilst this
      provided valuable experience and the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, I quickly found that the
      demands of agency work often led to creating bloated websites. Client expectations and the desire to impress
      with flashy features, frequently resulted in overly complex designs and an overreliance on third-party
      services and packages. This often felt at odds with my desire to create elegant and user-friendly experiences.
      I began to crave projects with a more defined scope where I could prioritise simplicity and functionality over
      anything unnecessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, I greatly enjoy writing simple and clean, stripped back websites. I prefer to work on minimalist
      projects where only what is required is used. This means no invasive tracking scripts, no sneaky cookies and
      no intrusive pop-ups (unless totally necessary).

    <header><h2>Can I help you?</h2></header>

    <p>
      I believe that a website should be an extension of the person or the business that it represents. It should be
      intuitive, accessible and fast. My goal is to create websites that not only look good, but also provide a
      seamless user experience. I am passionate about web standards &amp; best practices and I strive to write
      clean, maintainable code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently available for freelance work. If you would have a project in mind that you would like to
      discuss, please email <a href="mailto:hello@kerrisharp.com">hello@kerrisharp.com</a>.
